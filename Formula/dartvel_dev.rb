# Dartvel — a batteries-included, AI-native full-stack platform built around
# Flutter.
#
# The formula, the pub.dev package and the npm package are all named
# `dartvel_dev`; the command is `dartvel`. They differ because `dartvel` was
# taken on pub.dev on 2026-08-06 by an unrelated package, so the published
# identifier carries the suffix and the thing you type does not.
#
# The checksums are the ones published with the release, so Homebrew refuses a
# download that does not match rather than installing whatever arrived. They
# were :no_check until the release existed to take them from.
#
# This installs a prebuilt binary rather than building from source. The CLI is
# a Dart program, but `dart build cli` links the Dart runtime and the Rust
# server library into a single executable, so there is nothing to depend on at
# run time -- no Dart, no Flutter, no cellar full of pub cache.
#
# Building an application still needs Flutter, for whichever target you are
# building. Running the CLI does not, which is why this formula has no
# dependencies at all.
